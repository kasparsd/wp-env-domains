# Domains for Local WordPress Environments

**Use `your-project.wpenv.net` or any other cool subdomain for your local development environment.**

All subdomains of the following hostnames resolve to `127.0.0.1` (localhost) and could be used to serve [`@wordpress/env`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wordpress/env) (hence the name) or any other local development environment:

- `*.wp-env.net`
- `*.wpenv.net`
- `*.wp-env.dev` ([require HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.dev))
- `*.wpenv.dev` ([require HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.dev))

## Notes

- These domains are currently maintained by [Kaspars](https://kaspars.net) and will aways resolve to `127.0.0.1`! I would happily gift them to the [WordPress Foundation](https://wordpressfoundation.org) (see my contact information on the website).

- These are real domain names (in the public registry) and could start pointing to unexpected places if I fail to renew them, for example.
